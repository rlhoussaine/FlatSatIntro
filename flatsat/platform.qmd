## Power Subsystem
- **Components:**
  - **Solar Panels:** Generate electrical power by converting solar energy.
  - **Batteries:** Store energy for use when the satellite is in Earth's shadow.
- **Purpose:** Provides and regulates power for all satellite subsystems.
- **Power Output:** Typically between 10 and 20 kW, depending on satellite design and mission requirements.

## Propulsion Subsystem
- **Functions:**
  - **Positioning (Initial Orbit Insertion):** Places the satellite in its intended geostationary orbit.
  - **Station Keeping:** Maintains satellite's position against gravitational forces.
  - **Deorbiting:** Ensures controlled descent at the end of the mission, removing the satellite from orbit.
- **Types of Propulsion:** 
  - **Chemical Propulsion:** Provides high thrust for orbit changes.
  - **Electric Propulsion:** Efficient for station-keeping maneuvers, using less fuel over time.

```

## Structure Subsystem
- **Purpose:** Provides mechanical integrity, ensuring satellite withstands the physical stresses during launch and operation.
- **Stress Factors:** 
  - **Acceleration:** Up to 4.5 g during launch.
  - **Acoustic Pressure:** Up to 140 dB due to intense launch sounds.
- **Components:** Reinforced frame and materials designed for durability in the harsh space environment.

## Thermal Subsystem
- **Function:** Manages satellite temperature, preventing overheating or freezing of sensitive components.
- **Challenges:** 
  - **Space Temperature Variability:** -120°C to +150°C.
- **Optimal Temperature Ranges:** 
  - **Batteries:** 0°C to +10°C.
  - **Electronics:** 10°C to +45°C.
  - **Antennas:** -150°C to +80°C.
- **Thermal Control Techniques:**
  - **Radiators and Heat Pipes:** Dissipate excess heat.
  - **Insulation:** Protects against extreme cold.

    S --> U[Electronics: 10  to +45 degrees celsius]
    S --> V[Antennas: -150 to +80 degrees celsius]
```

## Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS)
- **Purpose:** Maintains the satellite’s orientation and ensures it remains in its designated orbital position.
- **Components:**
  - **Gyroscopes:** Measure orientation.
  - **Reaction Wheels:** Control attitude without expending fuel.
  - **Thrusters:** Adjust orbit as needed for station keeping.
- **Positioning Requirements:** Accuracy within a few kilometers, with specific orientations for antenna alignment and solar panel exposure.

```

## Telemetry and Telecommand (TM/TC) Subsystem
- **Telemetry (TM):** Continuously monitors satellite status and transmits data to ground control.
- **Telecommand (TC):** Receives commands from ground control to execute operational tasks.
- **Example Operations:** Power adjustments, orbit corrections, and data collection from sensors.

    AD --> AF[Receives Commands from Ground]
```

## Onboard Computer (OBC) Subsystem
- **Role:** Acts as the satellite’s central processing unit, managing operations and coordinating responses to commands.
- **Functions:**
  - Processes data from sensors and telemetry.
  - Executes control commands to other subsystems.
  - Stores critical mission data.
- **Example:** The OBC on ESA’s BepiColombo mission, which provides autonomous operations for deep space.
