# FlatSat Overview

A **FlatSat** is a ground-based, test-ready version of a satellite with all its components laid out on a table rather than in a compact structure. This configuration allows for direct access to each subsystem, facilitating testing and troubleshooting in a controlled lab environment. 

## Purpose and Use

FlatSats are used primarily to test satellite systems and their interoperability before launch, ensuring each component functions correctly. This setup supports end-to-end operations as if in orbit, allowing for command and telemetry testing. For CubeSats, FlatSats provide a low-cost, modular test environment suitable for educational purposes, commercial applications, and experimental payloads.

## Typical Components

A FlatSat for CubeSat might include:
- **On-Board Computer (OBC)**
- **Power System**
- **Telemetry and Radio System**
- **Attitude and Orbit Control**
- **Navigation Receiver**

Additional slots are often available for custom hardware or experimental components, such as AI-based detection algorithms or radiation monitoring payloads.

## Advantages

1. **Accessibility**: Subsystems are physically separated, making them accessible for individual testing and replacement.
2. **Operational Simulation**: Commands can be sent via a simulated ground station, with telemetry received for analysis.
3. **Flexibility**: Engineers can easily swap or modify components, an asset for educational and fast-paced commercial projects.
4. **Testing New Technologies**: Allows for validation of new components like radiation-tolerant microcontrollers in a representative environment.

## Applications in Industry and Research

ESA, NASA, and other space organizations use FlatSats extensively to develop and validate CubeSat technologies, streamline component interoperability, and prepare hardware for space missions.
