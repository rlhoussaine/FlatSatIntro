# FlatSat Overview

A **FlatSat** is a ground-based, test-ready version of a satellite with all its components laid out on a table rather than in a compact structure. This configuration allows for direct access to each subsystem, facilitating testing and troubleshooting in a controlled lab environment. 

## Purpose and Use

FlatSats are used primarily to test satellite systems and their interoperability before launch, ensuring each component functions correctly. This setup supports end-to-end operations as if in orbit, allowing for command and telemetry testing. For CubeSats, FlatSats provide a low-cost, modular test environment suitable for educational purposes, commercial applications, and experimental payloads.

## Typical Components

A FlatSat for CubeSat might include:
- **On-Board Computer (OBC)**
- **Power System**
- **Telemetry and Radio System**
- **Attitude and Orbit Control**
- **Navigation Receiver**

Additional slots are often available for custom hardware or experimental components, such as AI-based detection algorithms or radiation monitoring payloads.

## Advantages

1. **Accessibility**: Subsystems are physically separated, making them accessible for individual testing and replacement.
2. **Operational Simulation**: Commands can be sent via a simulated ground station, with telemetry received for analysis.
3. **Flexibility**: Engineers can easily swap or modify components, an asset for educational and fast-paced commercial projects.
4. **Testing New Technologies**: Allows for validation of new components like radiation-tolerant microcontrollers in a representative environment.

## Endurance Flatsat

### Endurance data handling architecture

To describe the different components of the _flatsat_ planned for Endurance, Iâ€™m using the DHS view, which allows me to outline the communication protocols between the various systems.

The flatsat includes:

- Flight software
- Two mission onboard computers (OBCs) in [warm redundancy](../LearningMore/redundancy.qmd) to manage AOCS (orbit), PU, Com, Th, and equipment
- Ground segment software ([Yamcs](https://yamcs.org/)) for communication with the OBC
- [EGSE](../LearningMore/egse.qmd) for pre-launch spacecraft testing and simulation
- Flatsat computer
- [Simulation software](https://github.com/asynchronics/asynchronix)
- Power supply

**Note**: Mission OBCs differ from guidance, navigation, and control ([GNC](https://indico.esa.int/event/181/contributions/1436/attachments/1385/1610/ESA_GNC_Technologies_and_Test_Beds_for_ADR_and_Space_Tug_Applications.pdf)) OBCs (Rendezvous & Grippers) and attitude (ADCS) OBCs, which are also in warm redundancy pairs.

Three communication protocols are used:

- **Ethernet**
- **CAN-TS**
- **CAN-Open**
