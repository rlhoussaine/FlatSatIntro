# Endurance - Office Inauguration

## 1. Overview of Endurance Services

### In Geostationary Orbit (GEO):
- **Stationkeeping**: 
  - Service duration of up to 5 years
- **Orbital Transfer**: 
  - Capability to move the client to any GEO orbital slot or correct inclination
- **Attitude Control**: 
  - Fine attitude control with an accuracy of up to 0.04 degrees
- **End-of-Life (EOL) Disposal**: 
  - Transfer to a GEO graveyard orbit at the end of operations
