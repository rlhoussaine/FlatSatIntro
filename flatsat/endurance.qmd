# Endurance

Infinite Orbits' Endurance project is a technical solution for extending satellite lifespans in geostationary orbit. The 750 kg servicer is equipped with Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) technology, enabling it to autonomously dock with and stabilize aging satellites. It takes over station-keeping, prolonging satellite functionality by five years and managing end-of-life disposal to a "graveyard" orbit. Designed for compatibility with most geostationary satellites, Endurance is slated for its first mission in 2026, targeting high-efficiency, on-orbit service and satellite life extension.

## 1. Overview of Endurance Services

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
### In Geostationary Orbit (GEO):
- **Stationkeeping**: 
  - Service duration of up to 5 years
- **Orbital Transfer**: 
  - Capability to move the client to any GEO orbital slot or correct inclination
- **Attitude Control**: 
  - Fine attitude control with an accuracy of up to 0.04 degrees
- **End-of-Life (EOL) Disposal**: 
  - Transfer to a GEO graveyard orbit at the end of operations
