# CCSDS Space Communication Protocols

The CCSDS standards cover space communication protocols to ensure interoperability between agencies. These documents define three main protocols:
- **Space Packet Protocol (SPP)**: for structuring and transporting space data in a generic way.
- **Telecommand (TC) Space Data Link Protocol**: for sending commands from ground to a satellite.
- **Telemetry (TM) Space Data Link Protocol**: for returning telemetry from a satellite to the ground.

## Space Packet Protocol (SPP)

The SPP (CCSDS 133.0-B-2) is an Application Layer protocol for structuring and transporting data in the form of "space packets."

### SPP Packet Structure

    A[Packet Primary Header]
    B[Packet Secondary Header]
    C[Data Field]

    A -->|7 bytes| B
    B -->|variable| C
```

### Key Features
- **Application Identification** through the APID (Application Process Identifier) field.
- **Data Flexibility**: variable packet sizes for increased adaptability.
- **Independence from Lower Layers**: can be used with different link protocols.

## Telecommand (TC) Space Data Link Protocol

The TC Space Data Link Protocol (CCSDS 232.0-B-4) manages command communication from ground to satellites. It operates at the Data Link Layer.

### TC Channel Hierarchy

    A[Master Channel]
    B1[Virtual Channel 1]
    B2[Virtual Channel 2]
    C1[MAP Channel 1]
    C2[MAP Channel 2]
    C3[MAP Channel 3]

    A --> B1
    A --> B2
    B1 --> C1
    B2 --> C2
    B2 --> C3
```

### Key Features
- **Segmentation and Multiplexing**: data is split into multiple virtual channels.
- **Communication Control**: ensures reliable delivery and integrity checks for commands.
- **Security Support (SDLS)** for protecting sensitive command data.

## Telemetry (TM) Space Data Link Protocol

The TM Space Data Link Protocol (CCSDS 132.0-B-3) is used to send telemetry data from a satellite to the ground, also operating at the Data Link Layer.

### Asynchronous and Synchronous Service Model

```

### Key Features
- **Support for Virtual Channels** to differentiate telemetry data streams.
- **Multiplexing/Demultiplexing** of data into master and virtual channels.
- **SDLS Security Option** to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of telemetry data.

### Protocol Comparison

| Protocol | OSI Layer    | Main Function                    | Security      |
|----------|--------------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| SPP      | Application  | Transporting data as packets    | N/A           |
| TC       | Data Link    | Sending commands                | SDLS Support  |
| TM       | Data Link    | Sending telemetry               | SDLS Support  |
